This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built with React.js. The app allows two players to play against each other in a classic 3x3 grid format, aiming to align three Xs or Os horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win the game. The application showcases fundamental React concepts such as state management, event handling, conditional rendering, and component-based structure.

**Features**
**Player turns:** Alternating between two players, X and O, to mark their spots on the grid.
**Win detection:** The game detects when a player has won or if there is a draw.
**Minimal, responsive design:** Simple and user-friendly interface for desktop devices.
